AI Builder is part of Microsoftâ€™s ongoing efforts to democratize AI, empowering users of all skill levels to build, train, and publish AI models in a no-code, guided, point and click environment. Available in public preview, anyone can now infuse AI within their business applications with PowerApps, or add intelligence to work processes with Flow.
